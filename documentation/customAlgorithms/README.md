# Adding custom algorithms to DebiAI

Projects have their own specific needs and sometimes the algorithms that are available in DebiAI are not enough. That's why DebiAI allows you to add your own algorithms.

Adding an algorithm to DebiAI allows you to use it with the data directly from the dashboard and analyze the results like any other project data.

Different kinds of algorithms can be added to DebiAI, ranging from data quality to metrics calculation, from data transformation using machine learning models to anomaly detection.
